                <p> I began my path of computer science several years ago. 
                    I was just about to leave middle school for high school and had the
                    opprotunity to go to Meridian Technical Charter High School. I decided to
                    enter the lottery and try out a path in the world of technology. I have
                    stayed fast to that path ever since.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Since that turning point in my life, I have worked to increase my knowledge
                    and understanding of computer science. I have coded from scratch several
                    websites with HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. A wordpress site followed
                    that with a small PHP introduction. I participated in Code to Succuss, a free
                    summer program offered in my area my Senior year. I have worked in C# both in 
                    the console in a class and on my own to work in Unity.
