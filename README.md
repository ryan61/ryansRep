# My Portfolio Application

This is an application I worked on the summer of my Senior year of high school. It was a camp held at Skyridge Monday-Thursday 6 hours every day for the entirety of the summer minus some days off for the 4th of July.

This is a ruby-on-rails application. It was meant to be a website feature a variety of different features like drag-and-drop. However this was not hooked up to any sort of web service. At the end of the camp we were invited to do so if we wanted but the camp was not going to teach AWS do to limited time.
